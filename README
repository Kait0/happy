This is the source code of the happy tool, an implementation of a TCP
connection establishment time measurement tool. It was originally
developed to study the effectiveness of the happy eyeballs algorithm
defined in RFC 6555 but it turns out to be useful for other purposes
as well. Further documentation is in the man page.

The build environment uses cmake and hence the code should be fairly
portable. However, patches that improve portability of fix bugs are
always welcome.

The code is covered by the Simplified BSD License.
