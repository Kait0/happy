<p><code>happy</code> is a simple TCP happy eyeballs probing tool. It uses non‐blocking <code>connect()</code> calls to establish connections concurrently to a number of possible endpoints. This tool is particularly useful to determine whether happy eyeball [RFC 6555] applications will use IPv4 or IPv6 if both are available.</p>
